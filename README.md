# CS450

I had to do a bunch of different machine learning/dating mining algorithms for this class. Good fun. Some I completely made from scratch (like neural nets!) and others i just implemented and used them. Most of it was done in Python, but there was some of it that I did in R. Here is a list of some algorithms:

- k Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Trees
- Neural Networks (Multilayer Perceptrons)
- Apriori
- Clustering
- Social Networking Analysis
- Support Vector Machines
- Ensemble

I had to do these with all sorts of datasets - nominal and numerical.
